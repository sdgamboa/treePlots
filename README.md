Generate a simple tree


I need to export to txt in R and then export to newick from within python.
Otherwise, the file cannot be processed correctly by GraPhlan.


```
graphlan.py sp_tree.newick newtree.png --size 100 # it seems that 100 is the limit for this tree (I get errors otherwise).
```

`--size 25` seems to be a good option
